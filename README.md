# Text-Summarization-Using-BART
## Text Summarization with BART and PyMuPDF
This Python script leverages BART, a powerful sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization, along with PyMuPDF for handling PDFs. It extracts text from a PDF, generates a summary using BART, and saves the summary as a new PDF.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

pip3 install PyMuPDF transformers 
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SandyeepSharma/Text-Summarization.git
cd Text-Summarization
Run the script with your PDF file:
python text_summarization.py
